      <h3>NAV-RAJHANS SHORT STORY WRITING COMPETITION</h3>
      <p>
        As a child we all have loved telling stories and most of the times we
        had 'created' them. Sometimes to hide our own mischief and sometimes
        just to save a friend / sibling from getting punished.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are we still good at it? Let's find out by participating in this unique
        competition.
